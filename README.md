# SSH EXPLANATION:

SSH stands for "Secure Shell." It's a way to connect to a computer securely from another computer over the internet. Imagine you're sending a secret message to a friend, but you don't want anyone else to be able to read it. You could put the message in a box and lock it with a key. You would send the box to your friend, and they would unlock it with their own key to read the message.

SSH works in a similar way. It uses a special encrypted channel to allow you to remotely connect to a computer, like the one you might use at work or school. This makes sure that nobody else can see what you're doing, and that your connection is secure. The client-server paradigm means that your computer is the client, and the computer you're connecting to is the server. The two communicate through this secure channel to keep your information safe.

**SSH KEY OF GITHUB? IS THE SAME THING?**

Yes, the SSH protocol used for secure remote access to a server is the same protocol used for authentication and secure communication with your GitHub account.

When you generate an SSH key on your computer and add the public key to your GitHub account, it allows you to securely authenticate with GitHub and perform operations like pushing changes to a repository without needing to enter your username and password every time. The SSH key is used as a secure and convenient way to verify your identity to GitHub.
